/*Write a program to accept data of employees from a file employee.txt. The first integer
on the file would be number of employees N, followed by N employee IDs. This would
be followed by their corresponding categories. The last N entries correspond to number
of hours worked by each employee during the week. Print the employee IDs in one line
followed by corresponding category in second line. In the third line print number of
hours worked by each employee.
 Now delete the records corresponding to second employee and shift the array elements
accordingly. Carry out the printing operation in similar manner as done earlier. Finally, print
the count of total number of shifts carried out in the program. */
